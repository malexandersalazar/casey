## Semantic Memory System

Semantic memory is Casey's adaptive knowledge system that can be specialized for any field or domain. It's like a sophisticated knowledge base that:

Can be loaded with specialized content from any field (psychology, history, science, literature, etc.)
Processes and organizes this information for relevant retrieval
Learns from interactions to improve understanding and responses

While Casey's semantic memory system is technologically capable of handling any domain of knowledge, we've currently focused it on mental wellbeing by loading it with professional psychological resources, mental health publications, and evidence-based guides. This focus wasn't chosen because of technical limitations, but because we recognize the urgent need for accessible mental health support in vulnerable populations.

### Purpose
Stores processed knowledge and conclusions derived from content creation and interactions, enabling:
- Knowledge accumulation over time
- Contextual understanding
- Improved response accuracy
- Knowledge synthesis

### Technical Implementation

#### Components
1. **SemanticMemoryModule**
   - Core processing engine for knowledge extraction
   - Fact crystallization system
   - Vector database integration

2. **Vectara Service**
   - Vector database for fact storage
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Relationship mapping

3. **Groq LLM**
   - Knowledge extraction
   - Fact validation
   - Context processing

### Workflow

1. **Trigger Points**
```
InteractionManager -> ArticleWritingProcessor -> SemanticMemoryModule
```

2. **Processing Steps**
   ```python
   # 1. Content Creation
   ArticleWritingProcessor generates content
   
   # 2. Knowledge Extraction
   SemanticMemoryModule.__extract_knowledge():
     - Processes raw text
     - Identifies key facts
     - Ensures fact independence
   
   # 3. Storage
   SemanticMemoryModule.crystallize_knowledge():
     - Validates facts
     - Stores in vector database
     - Creates relationships
   ```

3. **Data Structure**
   ```xml
   <semantic_memories>
     <fact>
       <content>Independently comprehensible fact</content>
       <metadata>
         <source>article_writing</source>
         <timestamp>2024-03-21 14:30:00</timestamp>
       </metadata>
     </fact>
   </semantic_memories>
   ```

### Unique Features
- Self-contained fact extraction
- Relationship preservation
- Context-aware storage
- Knowledge synthesis capabilities
